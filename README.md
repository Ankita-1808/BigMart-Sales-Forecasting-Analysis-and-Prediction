# BigMart Sales Forecasting Analysis and Prediction

Welcome to the BigMart Sales Forecasting Analysis and Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources for building a predictive model to forecast the sales of various products across different stores. By leveraging this model, BigMart aims to understand the key factors that influence product sales and optimize their strategies to boost revenue.

## Problem Statement

BigMart's data scientists have gathered sales data for 2013, encompassing 1559 products across 10 stores in various cities. In addition to sales figures, several attributes of each product and store have been defined. The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the sales of each product at a specific store.

The insights gained from this model will help BigMart identify the properties of products and stores that significantly impact sales, enabling the company to make informed decisions to enhance their business performance.

## Challenges

The dataset contains missing values due to technical glitches that caused some stores to not report all data. Therefore, it is essential to handle these missing values appropriately to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the predictive model.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Technocolabs100/BigMart-Sales-Forecasting-Analysis-and-Prediction.git
cd BigMart-Sales-Forecasting-Analysis-and-Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can explore and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to understand the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building steps. Additionally, the `scripts` directory contains Python scripts for data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training.

## Model Building

The model building process involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions and relationships.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features to enhance model performance.
4. **Model Training:** Training various regression models and selecting the best-performing model.
5. **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Results

The results of the model, including performance metrics and sales predictions, can be found in the `results` directory. Detailed analysis and visualizations are provided in the corresponding Jupyter notebooks.
